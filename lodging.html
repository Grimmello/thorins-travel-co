    <h1>Lodging on your adventure</h1>
    <h2>When you need a rest from a hard day's work</h2>
    <p>
      Our company is no stranger to weary eyes and low rations. When you find yourself in need of rest, we have just the places for you. If elves strike your fancy, then Rivendell will always be a welcome sight. If you like farmstays, Beorn's cabin is laden with honey and good mead*. Want to enjoy a relaxing boat ride? Laketown is the destination for you. Whatever your preference, we know you will love all of our warm and wonderful destinations.
